Hi, I'm Veronica Michelle.

I'm a Toronto-based designer and maker. I graduated from OCAD University with a Bachelor's in Graphic Design in 2018, but I make all kinds of things - images, posters, photos, books, games, jewellery, ceramics, pasta, and music - But I'm willing to try anything!

I'd love to be a part of your next project, especially if that project is concerning food, the environment, cats and other animals, or games! <a href="mailto:contact@veronicamichelle.com">Send me an email and let's work together!</a>
