<!--Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page. It's easy to include images, in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so: 

	---
	layout: post
	title: Project
	description: a project with a background image
	img: /img/12.jpg

<p>Mother Tongues is a project to create an intimate experience between two people.
This is an experience you share with someone you have never met.
It is a conversation where only one person is speaking, and you are only listening.
Non-native English speakers share the story of their favourite childhood place with you, spoken in their mother tongue.
They share with you their strongest experience from childhood in the language of their childhood.
The experience is at its strongest when you listen to a story from someone in a language you donâ€™t understand, and allow yourself to create the memory in your mind from the way they say their words.</p>
