<p>The Brownie Law is a visual novel where you, as a Brownie Scout, must make some new friends and bring them back with you to the cult – I mean, club!</p>

<p>There are 3 girls you think would be well suited to join the Brownie Scouts, but to gain their trust you must first talk to them… And befriend them. No matter what it takes.</p>

<p>Talk to people and convince them to join the club, and remember, never take no for an answer. It’s all for a good cause, and I swear on this by the Brownie Law!</p>

<p>And no one ever breaks the Brownie Law…</p>
